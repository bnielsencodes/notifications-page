## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

### What I Learned

This was a good test of my React skills. It especially furthered my learning in state, as it took me a good bit of trouble shooting and tinkering.

### Continued Development

With my next frontendmentor.io project, I plan to further my understanding of state in React. Also, will probably incorporate Tailwind into React.

As for in general, I plan on learning Redux, Next.js, Styled Components, and Vite.
